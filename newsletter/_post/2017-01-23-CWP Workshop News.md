The Community White Paper (CWP) workshop, which was organised by the HSF, took place in UCSD, San Diego, on Jan23-26 2017. 
The aim of the workshop was to start the process of writing a Commuinty White Paper that describes the roadmap for addressing the challenges that will be faced in the area of software and computing over the next 10 years. It is expected that the computing models will need to evolve and a significant “software upgrade” will be required in order to face the increasing demands of the experimental programmes in the major HEP laboratories world-wide. In order to identify and prioritize the software research and development investments required, we are now beginning a community planning process. The aim is to produce a Community White Paper (CWP) which will describe the community strategy and a roadmap for software and computing R&D in HEP for the 2020s. This activity is organised under the umbrella of the HSF. The LHC experiments and HSF have been specifically charged by the WLCG project and we are reaching out to other HEP experiments around the world to participate.
The workshop was attended by 70 people representing many different laboratories, universities and institutions (~30) from both sides of the Atlantic. The [Agenda](https://indico.cern.ch/event/570249/overview) was a mix 
of (lively!) general discussions and topical/hands-on sessions. Live 
notes of these discussions are 
[available](/organization/2016/05/04/Workshop-summary.html). 
This newsletter summarizes them.
