The HSF had its third workshop at LAL (Orsay, France) on May 2-4, 2016. It 
was well attended (70 people) representing many different laboratories, 
universities and institutions (~30) from both sides of the Atlantic, 
involved in different experiments (LHC, BELLE II, Intensity Frontier...). 
We were happy to see a lot of new faces!
The [Agenda](https://indico.cern.ch/event/496146/timetable/) was a mix 
of (lively!) general discussions and topical/hands-on sessions. Live 
notes of these discussions are 
[available](/organization/2016/05/04/Workshop-summary.html). 
This newsletter summarizes them.

One of the breaking news is that the HSF now has a logo! Thanks to 
J. Lingemann, the winner of the logo contest, and to all of you who took the
time to submit a logo proposal.
