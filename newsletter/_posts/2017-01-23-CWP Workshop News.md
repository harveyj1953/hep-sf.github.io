The challenges posed by the rapidly changing technology landscape and by strongly increasing demands of the various HEP experimental programmes is expected to lead to changes in HEP computing models as well as a significant upgrade of existing experimental software. A community planning process has been launched in order to identify and prioritize the software research and development investments required, with a view to writing a Community White Paper that describes the roadmap for addressing the challenges that will have to be faced over the next 10 years. 

The workshop took place in UCSD, San Diego, on Jan23-26 2017 and was attended by 70 people representing many different laboratories, universities and institutions (~30) from both sides of the Atlantic. It was organised under the umbrella of the HSF in order to reach out to the whole HEP community.The [Agenda](https://indico.cern.ch/event/570249/overview) was a mix 
of (lively!) general discussions and topical/hands-on sessions. Live 
notes of these discussions are 
[available](/organization/2016/05/04/Workshop-summary.html). 
This newsletter summarizes them.
